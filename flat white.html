<h4><ins>History: </ins></h4>
<p> 
These days, flat whites are hip. They’re listed on chalkboards of many local coffee shops alongside lattes, cortados, and cappuccinos. Even Vogue has dubbed the drink their “latest coffee obsession.
” But there always seems to be confusion: what is a flat white, exactly? There are some commonly agreed upon facts, to be sure.
A flat white is made with espresso and milk that’s been steamed, and ideally, that milk is delicately poured into the shape of a fern or a leaf. 
The flat white looks like a cappuccino, but it’s not a cappuccino—and if asked to elaborate on the difference, most Americans would freeze with confusion.
But what most Americans do know about flat whites is that they’re now served in Starbucks, in addition to their local or artisanal coffee shop. 
Around the world, Google searches for “flat white” spiked in January 2015, after Starbucks announced it would be adding the drink to American menus—a move that would, “Honor Coffee Artistry and Espresso Craft with New Flat White,” according to the headline of the press release.
But to call the flat white “new” is a huge overstatement. Even though it’s only recently appeared on American menus, it’s been a staple in Australian and New Zealand cafes since the 1980s, and really, folks shouldn’t be embarrassed about being confused by this espresso-based beverage because it seems like every barista from New York to Sydney has their own interpretation of how to make a flat white.
Even the origins of the flat white are deeply disputed and generally confusing.
There is much debate on this subject, and it’s shrouded in mystery and speculation from both sides of the Tasman Sea,” explains Andrew Smart, founder of the Espresso Workshop in Auckland, New Zealand. “I can’t really profess to know who started serving the flat white first,
but I am a New Zealander, so I will say…for sure it was created in New Zealand!” There’s some compelling evidence to support his assertion, to be fair.” Derek Townsend, a New Zealander who owned the now-defunct cafe DKD in Auckland, 
claims to have made the first flat white in 1986—though he does admit to having stolen the name “flat white” from a cafe in Melbourne, Australia. But another New Zealand man, Fraser McInnes, who used to work at a cafe in Wellington, also claims to have “accidentally” invented the flat white in 1989. As he explained in a video shot and published by New Zealand news outlet Stuff, he was trying to make a cappuccino but failed to “get [the milk] to fluff, so in the end, I went up to the lady and said, ‘Look, I’m sorry. But it’s a flat white.”

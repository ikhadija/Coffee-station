<h4><ins>History: </ins></h4>
<p>
    Coffee was first introduced to Paris in 1669 by Suleyman Aga, the ambassador to the court of King Louis XIV of France. Aga was sent by Mohammed IV with sacks of coffee. 
    He described it as a magical beverage when mixed with a small quantity of cloves, cardamom seeds and sugar, which in those day was bought by the ounce at the apothecary’s shop. 
    He also brought the apparatus used for the preparation of the Turkish style coffee drink. It included china dishes, and small pieces of muslin embroidered with gold, silver, and silk, used as napkins.
    He became the darling of Parisian society, remaining in the city long enough firmly to establish the custom he had introduced.
    Paris gets its first taste of coffee Two years later, in 1671, an Armenian whom everyone called Pascal, opened a coffee-drinking booth at the fair of St. 
    Germain. He offered the beverage for sale from a tent, supplemented by the service of Turkish waiter boys, who peddled it among the crowds from small cups on trays. 
    The fair was held during the first two months of spring. It took place on a large open plot just inside the walls of Paris and near the Latin Quarter.
    As Pascal’s waiter boys circulated through the crowds on those chilly days the fragrant odor of freshly made coffee encouraged many sales of the steaming beverage. 
    Soon visitors to the fair learned to look for the “little black” cupful of cheer, or petit noir, a name that still endures.
    This marked the beginning of Parisian coffee houses.In 1686, the Café de Procope was opened by Sicilian chef Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli.
    He had come to Paris from Italy acquiring a royal license to sell spices, ices, barley water and lemonade. As a keen business man he added coffee to the list and soon attracted a large and rather distinguished clientele: noted French actors, authors, dramatists and musicians. 
    With the opening of the Café de Procope, coffee became firmly established in Paris.
    The first merchant licensed to sell coffee in Paris was François Damame, who secured the privilege through an edict of 1692.
    He was given the sole right for 10 years to sell coffee in all the provinces and towns of the kingdom, and in all territories under the sovereignty of the king. Every city in France soon had its coffee houses.

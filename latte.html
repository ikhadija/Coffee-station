<h3><ins> History: </ins></h3>
<p>
Whether you call it a caffe latte, cafe au lait, or cafe con leche, the Latte is a drink that has stood the test of time.
It has become one of the quintessential drinks of the modern coffee shop, but how did it get there? The history of the latte is a long and fascinating tale with as many layers as the art that traditionally tops them.
First, let’s begin with what is a latte? The modern latte is a combination of, typically, a double shot of espresso mixed with steamed milk.
They can be made hot or iced and come in a variety of flavors. It is a simple, delicious drink that fuels many people around the world each morning.
What we now know as a latte would confuse many of its original drinkers.
Early History of the Latte Europeans have been mixing coffee and milk since at least the 17th Century.
The term “caffe e latte” was first used by William Dean Howells in his 1867 essay “Italian Journeys”.
At this point in history, coffee is starting to become a worldwide sensation, but the brewing methods were still very primitive as espresso machines had not been invented yet

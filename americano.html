<h4><ins> History: </ins></h4>
<p>
Americans were accustomed to drip-brewing coffee and adding milk for a lighter taste. Other than espresso, Italians would also drink cappuccino.
While this was closer in strength and taste to what Americans were used to, it was much smaller in size.
A cappuccino is a 5-ounce serving of espresso with frothy milk, compared to a 16-ounce cup of regular drip coffee. 
To accommodate U.S. soldiers, coffee shops started serving shots of espresso in full-size coffee cups and filling up the rest with hot water. 
Individuals could then add sugar and milk to taste. Word spread quickly about this drink, and it was dubbed the “Americano.”
Italians are known to refer to this mixture of their beloved espresso as “dirty water.” 
A major difference between drip coffee and the Americano is how espresso is made. When brewed properly, espresso has a creamy layer on top called “crema.” 
This is the mark of a truly excellent brew and is not formed during drip brewing. 
This same layer can be found on an Americano,and an Americano connoisseur knows to look for that fine detail.

<h4><ins>History : </ins></h4>
<p>
    Espresso is both the simplest and the purest form of coffee you can have. It’s an expression of Italian coffee culture and a global icon. When we think of coffee in its most idealized form, we think espresso.
    Some people imagine that espresso is one of the oldest coffee beverages around. In fact, it’s old but not that old.
    Espresso was invented by a brilliant Milanese inventor by the name of Luigi Bezzera, who coupled his passion for steam with a love of coffee and came up with the brilliant yet simple idea of making coffee with steam pressure.
    This revolutionized the concept of making coffee with a pot of boiling water.
    In 1905, Bezzera’s patent was bought by a Desidero Pavoni who commercialized the world’s first espresso machine: La Ideale
    Though revolutionary for its time, the “Ideale” bears little resemblance to modern espresso machines. It reached an average temperature of 140 degrees and a 1.5-bar pressure compared to today’s 9-bar pressure machines.
    The result was more akin to filter coffee than what we would describe as an espresso today.
    The new method provided a quick way to make a single, powerful cup of coffee. The word espresso means « pressed coffee » in Italian but it also carries with it the connotation of speed.
    Though this method was seen as both novel and revolutionary, its popularity was dampened by the burnt taste due to the use of steam.
    However, a new modern coffee culture started to develop in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century.
     In 1920, the word “espresso” entered the official Italian lexicon described in Alfredo Panzini’s Italian dictionary as: “caffe espresso, made using a pressurized machine or a filter, now commonplace.”

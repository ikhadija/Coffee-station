  <h4><ins>History : </ins></h4>
  <p>
  The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears as the legend of an Ethiopian goatherd named Kaldi who noticed a change in the behavior of his goats when they ate the berries of the coffee trees.
  It is certain that by the middle of the 15th century, coffee was in use in Yemen's Sufi monasteries. Sufis used it to keep themselves alert during their nighttime devotions.
  A translation of Al-Jaziri's manuscript[10] traces the spread of coffee from Arabia Felix (the present day Yemen) northward to Mecca and Medina, and then to the larger cities of Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, and Constantinople. 
  In 1511, it was forbidden for its stimulating effect by conservative, orthodox imams at a theological court in Mecca.
  However, these bans were to be overturned in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Suleiman I, with Grand Mufti Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi issuing a fatwa allowing the consumption of coffee.
  In Cairo, Egypt, a similar ban was instituted in 1532, and the coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee beans were sacked.
  Arabic coffee is made from coffee beans roasted very lightly or heavily from 165 to 210 °C (329 to 410 °F) and cardamom, and is a traditional beverage in Arab culture.
  Traditionally, it is roasted on the premises (at home or for special occasions), ground, brewed and served in front of guests. It is often served with dates, dried fruit, candied fruit or nuts.
  Arabic coffee is defined by the method of preparation and flavors, rather than the type of roast beans. Arabic coffee is boiled coffee that is not filtered, made black. Sugar is not typically added, but if so, it can be added during preparation or when serving. 
  It is served in a small delicate cup without handles, called finjān. Sometimes, the coffee is moved to a larger and more beautiful pour pitcher to serve in front of the guests, called Della. Often, though, the host prepares coffee in the kitchen and highlights a tray of small cups of coffee.
  Unlike Turkish coffee, traditional Arabic coffee, with its roots in Bedouin tradition, is usually unsweetened (qahwah saada), but sugar can be added depending on the preference of drinker.[citation needed] However, this coffee is never sweet syrup, but rather strong and bitter.
  [citation needed] To make up for the bitter flavor, coffee is usually served with something sweet – dates are a traditional accompaniment – and other desserts are often served along with a tray of coffee cups.
